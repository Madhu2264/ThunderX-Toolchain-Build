To build, simply run ./build.sh

The current Dockerfile has a patch to apply to the source code.
You need to put the patch file in the data/ directory and copy
it into the docker as shown in the Dockerfile.

You can adjust the patching by changing the Dockerfile. Please
remember to update the package name in the .spec file in
the data directory.

You also need to update the package name in the build.sh to copy
it out at the end of the build.
