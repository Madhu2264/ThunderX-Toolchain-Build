We did not distinguish the different versions of ubuntu OS here as
they are basically the same. keep one copy will make maintenance
easier.

To change from one version of ubuntu to another, simply change

patches get involved.

You need to change this data/control file to match the
Dockerfile's package name.

You need then put the package name in the build.sh to
copy it out.
